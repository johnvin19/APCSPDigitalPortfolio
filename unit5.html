			   <br><br>5. When ordering off a menu, you can search sequentially until you find something you'd like. By going through each item on the menu, you would compare each meal to what you want.

The search function allows the user to easily access the question they want instead of having to click next many times.      <br>e. The search algorithm uses a repeat and counter variable that basically counts up to the max number of questions and when it finds the keyword it will set the questions and images to the set that contains the keyword.

			  <br><br>2. After collecting data and seeing the graphs we came to the conclusion that Search algorithm 1 is a sequential sorting algorithm and Search Algorithm 2 is a Binary sorting algorithm. We thought this because the time it takes for Search Algorithm 1 is longer compared to Search Algorithm 2.  Since knowing that binary sorting algorithm is faster than a sequential sorting algorithm we know that Search Algorithm 1 is the sequential sorting algorithm.

		  <p>1. The optimal scheme for withstanding a brute force attack of at least 10 years would be a password with 9 characters that consists of a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. 
			  <br><br>2. We would have to modify the password to make it have 11 characters consisting of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters to withstand a 10 year attack by the computer.
			  <br><br>3.<br>a. An optimal password scheme would have 11 characters.<br>b.It would have both upper/lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

		  <p>1. It took the simultaneous processing approach to be used for sequential tasks plus the longest of its concurrent tasks. In the pogil activity, the cards were grouped into 4 piles, and the 4 team members each sorted through the cards to find the card in parallel. The activities got faster because more processes ended up being involved. 
			   <br><br>2. 9:00 - 9:11. 11 Minutes Total
			   <br><br>3. I think if we doubled the number of processors we would be able to octuple in speed. If we are all on task then the proccess should work without consequence.
			   <br><br>4. Parallel sequencing saves time, enabling programs to be carried out in a shorter wall clock time, which in a smaller amount of time often addresses larger problems.

		  <p>1. Web search tools will track and save your search history to help you find what you're looking for. This means that the next time you search, it will recommend material to you based on your interests.
			  <br><br>2. Google employs a sorting algorithm known as PageRank. This method sorts over information indexes. They are all graded based on their dependability, amount of times referenced, and sources cited within the article. This algorithm is used to place the most valuable and relevant links at the front of the search results page.
			  <br><br>3. A captcha is a mechanism that is used to avoid undesired sources like spam. Captcha employs a variety of ways to evaluate whether or not the user is, in fact, a person with a genuine desire to access what the captcha is protecting. These generally include inputting letters into a box, identifying certain photos, or matching shapes.
			  <br><br>4. This is something I agree with because search has made it easy and simple to acquire information since the beginning of the internet. 
			  <br><br>5. Figure 4.10 shows a screenshot of a Google search result in the United States, while Figure 4.11 shows a screenshot of a Google search result in China. . The Chinese search results are biased, while the US ones are more factual and neutral.
			  <br><br>6. I think mobile computing is both beneficial and harmful to web searches because it makes it easy to search but people would lose their privacy.
			  <br><br>7.  I would keep my search history because when I forget something I can find it easier.
			  <br><br>8. Yes if several sources agree with eachother.
			  <br><br>9. It is important to talk about what information you choose to put on the internet because social implications like cyber bullying could happen.
			  <br><br>10. Personal and general information is used to create search trends. The advantage of this is that the most popular and reliable sites will display first on the results page, resulting in a better user experience because it saves time. As a result of selecting the most popular sites, search trends may exclude some sites that you might have wanted to visit.
			  <br><br>11. The title of this article is "What is an Algorithm?", by Jessica Teran. It was published on October 16, 2018. This article talks about relevancy, individual factors, and off-page factors. The goal of a search algorithm is to quickly identify and deliver the most relevant or valuable information to the user. All search engines differentiate certain things like most relevant, most useful or even spam. The result's end using rankings that help the user the most.
			  <br><br>Relevancy is a major element in search engines. This is because personalized searches and advertisements are more likely to be clicked or displayed. Keywords, which are also important factors, rank higher when they appear in titles, headlines, and the first few phrases. Search engines may scan the text of a website to see how keywords are utilized and if the page is relevant to what you're looking for. The frequency with which you search for keywords influences a site's relevance.
			  <br><br>Search engines use a variety of variables to determine how they search and crawl websites, how they penalize sites for keyword spamming, and how many websites they index. Google contains more pages than Bing and provides a separate set of search results. Things that help ranking include hyperlinking and click-through measure. Because search algorithms are so important in search engine optimization and site rankings, you can make changes to a site to improve its ranking.
